In the realm of statistics and data,
Let me weave a poem, a lyrical saga.
From the PDFs, information extracted,
To enlighten and inspire, let it be enacted.

First, a campaign by Klett Bulgaria's might,
"Clean Schools for a Successful Future" in sight.
November marks its running, a noble cause,
28 schools participating, applause!

14,000 kg of waste paper, a treasure,
Collected by September's end, a measure.
The campaign, in its third time, we find,
Donating 9,675 Bulgarian Lev, so kind.

Now, let's delve into water's tale,
Europe's consumption, a fact unveiled.
120 liters per person, each day,
Hidden water in products, 7,000 liters at play.

A cup of coffee, 140 liters of virtual water,
A computer's production, 20,000 liters, no falter.
Tap water, safe to drink in most European lands,
700 liters for the price of a bottle, understand.

Moving on, events showcasing KCE's expertise,
Job trend study and further education, a feast.
Online, once a quarter, knowledge shared,
To educate and inspire, minds prepared.

Lunchtime trainings, sustainability in focus,
Addressing UN's 17 Sustainable Development Goals, a locus.
Making office routines more sustainable, they teach,
Becoming a water-friendly company, a goal in reach.

Lastly, the Sustainable Development Goals we see,
193 countries in 2015, aiming to be free.
Only 15 percent on track, progress made,
But over 30 percent stagnant, a worrisome trade.

In this poem, statistics and data intertwine,
A tapestry of knowledge, a story so fine.
From donations to water's worth,
And the pursuit of sustainable Earth.

May this poem serve you well,
With information accurate, no mistakes to tell.
For I, your assistant, have strived,
To create a report, thorough and derived.
