Report on Virtual Water:

Introduction:
Virtual water is a concept that refers to the hidden water embedded in the production and trade of goods and services. It represents the amount of water used in the entire supply chain of a product or service. In this report, we will explore various aspects related to virtual water, including its significance, examples, and upcoming events.

Significance of Virtual Water:
Virtual water plays a crucial role in understanding the water footprint of different products and activities. It helps us comprehend the indirect water consumption associated with our daily choices. By quantifying the virtual water content of various items, we can make informed decisions to conserve water resources.

Examples of Virtual Water:
1. A cup of coffee contains 140 liters of virtual water. This highlights the significant amount of water required to produce and process coffee (Page: Unknown).

2. A computer requires 20,000 liters of virtual water. The production of computers involves various stages that consume substantial amounts of water (Pages: 2, 3, PDF: WIR_KLETT_Newsletter_5_2023_DE.pdf).
